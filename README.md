# Noor Ali's Personal Website

This is the repository for my personal website, built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com).

The site features a dual-mode interface:
*   **Non-Technical View**: A clean, modern, single-page portfolio.
*   **Technical View**: An interactive terminal that mimics a real command-line interface.

## Features

*   **Toggleable Interface**: Switch between the standard graphical view and a terminal-based view.
*   **Interactive Terminal**:
    *   Execute commands like `help`, `about`, `skills`, `experiences`, and `contact`.
    *   Navigate command history with arrow keys.
    *   Launch mini-apps and animations like `slope` and `donut`.
*   **Responsive Design**: The site is designed to work well on different screen sizes.
